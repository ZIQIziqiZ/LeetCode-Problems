https://leetcode.cn/problems/subdomain-visit-count
***
*A website domain "discuss.leetcode.com" consists of various subdomains. At the top level, we have "com", at the next level, we have "leetcode.com"Â and at the lowest level, "discuss.leetcode.com". When we visit a domain like "discuss.leetcode.com", we will also visit the parent domains "leetcode.com" and "com" implicitly.*

*A count-paired domain is a domain that has one of the two formats "rep d1.d2.d3" or "rep d1.d2" where rep is the number of visits to the domain and d1.d2.d3 is the domain itself.*
```
For example, "9001 discuss.leetcode.com" is a count-paired domain that indicates that discuss.leetcode.com was visited 9001 times.
```
*Given an array of count-paired domains cpdomains, return an array of the count-paired domains of each subdomain in the input. You may return the answer in any order.*
