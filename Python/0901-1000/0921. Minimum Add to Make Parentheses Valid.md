***
*A parentheses string is valid if and only if:*
```
It is the empty string,
It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or
It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.
```
*You are given a parentheses string s. In one move, you can insert a parenthesis at any position of the string.*
```
For example, if s = "()))", you can insert an opening parenthesis to be "(()))" or a closing parenthesis to be "())))".
```
*Return the minimum number of moves required to make s valid.*
