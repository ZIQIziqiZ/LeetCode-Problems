***
*You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).*

*Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.*

*Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.*

*Notice that you may not slant the container.*
