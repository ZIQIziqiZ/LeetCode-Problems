***
*You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. You are initially positioned at nums[0].*

*Each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i. In other words, if you are at nums[i], you can jump to any nums[i + j] where:*
```
1 <= j <= nums[i] and
i + j < n
```
*Return the minimum number of jumps to reach nums[n - 1]. The test cases are generated such that you can reach nums[n - 1].*
